    "\n",
    "*Streptomyces scabies* is a plant pathogen that causes necrosis in potatoes. Many of its virulence factors are located in regions with low GC content. Additionally, virulence is highly expressed during interaction with plant roots. In this notebook, you will analyze a file named `aliens_in_scabies`, which contains over 1000 genes. The file provides gene names, their expression levels (growth in rich medium vs. interaction with plant roots), and GC content for each gene.\n",

    "1. Sort the table by gene expression levels.\n",
    "2. Create a new file with the top 10 highest expressed genes.\n",
    "3. Sort the top 10 genes by their GC content.\n",
    "4. Generate a new table with the gene names, replacing 'SCAB' with 'SCABIES'.\n",
    "5. Perform statistical analysis of the GC content and expression levels (min, max, average, median)."
